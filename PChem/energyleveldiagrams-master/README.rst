Energy Level Diagrams
=====================

An attempt to make "energy level diagrams" (Grotrian Diagrams) for atoms (or molecules) using
matplotlib.  So far, it's clearly targeted at hydrogen, since it has named
orbitals and cares about those orbitals.  But that was my goal anyway; I wanted
to visualize the branching ratios between different hydrogen transitions.
